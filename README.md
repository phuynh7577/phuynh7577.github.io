Live site: https://phuynh7577.github.io/


Installation instructions:  none needed.
					just enter the site address into a web browser.


Unsolved problems:    realtor only allows me to add 200 listings. Not sure if that's the 					default, if so then its not a problem. 

				in the future, I would like to add filters, and add min and max price 				for the user.
