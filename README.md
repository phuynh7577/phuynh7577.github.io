Technologies uses: html, css, javascript

approach:  Searched online for a real estate api. 
		Found realtor on rapidaip.com.
		Made a wireframe of the app with adobe XD.
		Found pictures on google and saved them to a folder.
		created html and css doc to match wireframe.
		Made the site responsive.
		Created js doc and started to create two modals.
		Once modal was done, started accessing realtor api using js.
		Pushed documents to git.
		active GitHub pages to review the site live.
		added select options in html to get filter options on property type and 			min and max prices.
		updated css to be more responsive and add sticky nav for the modal.







Live site: https://phuynh7577.github.io/


Installation instructions:  none needed.
					just enter the site address into a web browser.


Unsolved problems:    realtor only allows me to add 200 listings. Not sure if that's the 					default, if so then its not a problem.
